## Introduction

The selected Lee, Hall, & Wood, 2018 article replicated the finding that experiential purchases yielded greater happiness than material goods. Given resource distribution varies widely across the population, the authors posited that socio-economic status (IV) would play a significant role in individuals' self-evaluations of subjective happiness (DV) when reflecting on apportioned financial resouces. The authors define *experiential advantage* as experiential purchases generating more happiness than material goods. Findings from Study 1 (to be replicated) indicate differential effects of SES, such that participants from lower-income backgrounds were happier with material goods (as compared to spending money on experiences) while individuals from higher-income backgrounds reported experiential advantage.

Results are of value to my research program along two key dimensions. First, methodologically, the modifications made in the original study to the established measure offer an opportunity for me to explore how improved scale design (particularly of extant measures) can lead to more informative data. Second, theoretically, through this process I'm excited to understand how subjective assessment measures can be combined with straight-forward survey design and applied broadly to examine racialized experiences. For example, this approach might be useful for a future research question investigating whether framing biased behaviors or beliefs along a continuum yields significantly different results from a dichotomous scale. 

### Procedures

The selected study was an attempt to replicate a Van Boven and Gilovich (2003) design; however, Lee et al. (2018), incorporated some important modifications, which will be noted throughout the procedures write-up where appropriate. 

Participants were first given a computer-based survey using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) and prompted to recall a _recent_* "experiential purchase and object purchase" that lead to an increase in their happiness. Next, participants were asked which purchase made them happier. The presented scale was: -3 = Definitely experiential purchase, 3 = Definitely object purchase.**

Afterward, using the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, participants were presented with a visual of a ladder consisting of 10 steps. Subjects were instructed to think of the ladder as representing their position in society, with the most educated and wealthy at the top and people with the least respected jobs and education at the bottom. 

One challenge to reproducing this finding might be that I am relatively new to AMT, RStudio and programming more generally. Therefore, I anticipate there will likely be some time-management concerns, insofar as it will likely be difficult to accurately predict how long certain tasks should take to complete.

*Instead of having participants compare experiential purchases versus material acquistion from a global perspective (across the lifespan) as in the original, Lee et al. had participants compare more local (recent) spending.

**The current study employs a continuous scale for comparative purchase happiness rather than the dichotomous scale used in the original.     

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Although it wasn't reported in the original publication, I calculated the Pearson's correlation for the original data set and found .2294087, which I used for my power analysis. Based on this value, the study should include 146 participants (80% power), 195 participants (90% power), or 241 participants (95% power). These values were calculated using G*Power.

Participants in the pilot took 2 minutes on average and will be compensated 25 cents per HIT.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample should have approximately the same demographic characteristics as that in the original study because of AMT recruitment, which was as follows: "...209 adult U.S. residents participated on Amazon Mechanical Turk (52% women; age: M = 38.39 years, SD = 12.83). The target sample size (N = 200) was determined before data collection began, and a total of 209 participants actually completed the study." No participants were excluded, however, our total sample may ultimately be slightly different based on power analyses. We intend to recruit 146 participants on MTurk based on power analysis, which should give us 80% power.

### Materials

Study materials were made publicly available on the Open Science Framework (OSF), thus, stimuli used in this reproduction are expected to be the same as the original study (see ladder visual below).

**Measure of Comparative Purchase Happiness**:
"Comparative purchase happiness was assessed with the question, “Between the two purchases, which made you happier?” Responses were reported on a 7-point scale from −3 (definitely experiential purchase) to 3 (definitely object purchase)."

**Measure of Social Class**:
"Participants were shown a ladder with 10 rungs and given the following instructions:
Think of this ladder as representing where people stand in the U.S. At the top of the ladder are the people who are the best off—those who have the most money, the most education, and the most respected jobs. At the bottom are the people who are the worst off—who have the least money, least education, and the least respected jobs or no job. The higher up you are on this ladder, the closer you are to the people at the very top; the lower you are, the closer you are to the people at the very bottom."

### Procedure	

Procedures were followed precisely and are outlined, largely verbatim, below: 

"Participants were asked to 'think about a recent experiential purchase and object purchase that you made to increase your happiness.' No further information about the definition of these purchases was given."

"Next, participants reported their social class using the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status...In the past, researchers have measured social class through objective indicators of income, education, or occupation or have used the MacArthur Scale to capture subjective assessment of all three aspects." 

Next, participants were presented with eight demographics questions, including:  
1. About how much is your yearly family income?  
2. About how much is your yearly personal income?  
3. What is the highest level of education you have completed?  
4. What would you describe your family and yourself?  
5. Currently, what is the number of your household? (If a father, a mother, and a child are living together, then the answer would be 3.)  
6. What is your gender?  
7. How old are you? (in years)  
8. What is your race?

### Analysis Plan

My analyses will attempt to replicate the regression from the original paper. I will also calculate the Pearson correlation for the original data and new data set. 

**Key analysis of interest** 

Key confirmatory analysis will be "a regression analysis predicting comparative purchase happiness from social class," as stated in original publication, which "revealed that social class positively predicted happiness." My analytic approach should replicate, and therefore generate, something closely approximating the original figure. My current analytic plan does not include standardizing the beta. Both the IV (SES measure) and DV (subjective happiness rating) require reverse coding. 


**Strategy**  

1. Exclusions: Currently plan to include all participants, as the original study had no exclusions.

2. Cleaning: Tidy data by removing unnecessary columns (e.g., start date, end date, etc.), convert from wide to long, and ensure item values are accurately coded and that question labels from the build-phase translate to being intuitive for data analysis. 

3. Analysis: Run a linear regression to see whether SES predicts subjective happiness rating. The original figure indicates that the authors found values where "comparative purchase happiness was significantly different from 0." After speaking with some stats graduate students, I believe this was determined by using confidence intervals around the fixed values of the regression line and finding the values at which (out to two decimal places) the intervals are no longer inclusive of zero. This is the approach I am going to take in my analysis.

### Differences from Original Study

Given data will be collected using the same platform (AMT), with the same study materials, including visual stimuli (downloaded from the OSF), we can reasonably anticipate no significant differences between sample size and demographic composition, setting or procedure. 

We can expect some differences will occur (e.g., participant setting or time of study participation, two experimental variables that are not within our control) but, as this study is itself a replication which confirmed the findings of the original, it is not predicted that these differences will have large effects. 

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.


```{r}

#load library 
library("tidyverse")
```



```{r Import data}

#import data
 lee <- read_csv("251_Reproduce_November 24, 2019_04.17.csv")

```

### Data Preparation

```{r Removing rows and columns}

#Remove first two rows

lee2 <- lee %>% 
  filter(!((IPAddress == "IP Address") |
           IPAddress == "{\"ImportId\":\"ipAddress\"}")) %>% 
  
   mutate(subid = row_number()) %>%                     #Insert subject ID row
  select(contains("subid"), CompHap, MacArthurSES)       #Select relevant columns

```


```{r Recode and rename variables}

#Makes character class numeric
lee2$CompHap <- as.numeric(lee2$CompHap)  
lee2$MacArthurSES <- as.numeric(lee2$MacArthurSES) 

#Recoding IV and DV measures and renaming
d <- lee2 %>%         
 mutate(ComparativeHappiness=CompHap*-1) %>% # this recodes the two columns
  mutate(MacArthurScale=MacArthurSES*-1)

```

*Plotting the data*

Below the data from pilot b is plotted, and it already looks like the regression line is going to trend in the opposite direction of that in the original figure; however, this seems unconcerning given N=4 for pilot b. 

```{r}
d %>%
ggplot(aes(x = MacArthurSES, y = CompHap)) +
 geom_point(colour = "blue")
```



### Confirmatory analysis


*Looking at the p-value*

```{r}

 summary(lm(ComparativeHappiness~MacArthurScale,data=d))

```


*Plotting the model*

```{r}

figure <- d %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = MacArthurScale, y = ComparativeHappiness)) +
 geom_smooth(method = "lm", fill = NA)

figure + geom_hline(yintercept=0, color = "black") +
  # geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "black") +
    # xlim(c(1, 10)) +
  labs(x = "Social Class (Mac Arthur Scale)") +
  labs(y = "Comparative Purchase Happiness")  +
  ggthemes::theme_few()  

#Dashed lines (coded below) will be added once sample size is large enough to calculate
#  geom_vline(xintercept = XX, linetype="dashed", color = "blue") +
 # geom_vline(xintercept = XX, linetype="dashed", color = "blue")

#As mentioned above, the N here is very small (4), so it's unsurprising that this figure does not replicate the original study. The x-intercept is near that of the original. 

```

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

The figure in the original publication includes dashed lines (SEE: above) indicating the MacArthur scale values that differ significanlty from zero. As part of my exploratory analyses I intend to examine where comparative purchase happiness differs from the midpoint of the scale (significantly from zero) using confidence intervals for the fitted values of the regression line.

I will also plot their data and create a regression table.

*Getting Pearson correlation*


```{r}

cor(d$ComparativeHappiness, d$MacArthurScale)

```


*Finding the confidence intervals for fitted values in a linear regression*

```{r CI to determine where y significantly differs from 0}

l <- lm(ComparativeHappiness~MacArthurScale,data=d)      #run regresssion & assign variable

#Generate a list of CIs for each IV value--locate values that have CIs not intersecting 0

predict(l,newdata = data.frame
        (MacArthurScale=d$MacArthurScale),
        interval="confidence",level = 0.95)

```


```{r narrow down significant values}

#CIs will give interger values that can be manually reviewed to find significant values
  #the 7.02 in the code below is as an example

ci = predict(l,newdata = data.frame
             (MacArthurScale=7.02), 
             interval="confidence",level = 0.95)
ci

```


Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
